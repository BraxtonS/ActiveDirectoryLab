<h1>Active Directory Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This lab consists of going through the steps of creating an Active Directory home lab environment using Oracle Virtual Box. I did this in order to broaden my understanding of active directory and windows networking whilst hardening my knowledge on topics such as DHCP, NAT, and more. Starting from downloading Oracle Virtual Box and the associated ISOs for the VMs, I took a long journey constructing an actual network from the ground up consisting of a domain controller and an internal client that can both connect to the outside internet. 
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>PowerShell</b> 
- <b>Oracle Virtual Box</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)
- <b>Server 2019</b>
